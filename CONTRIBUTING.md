## This repository

This controller has been created using [kubebuilder](https://book.kubebuilder.io/). As such, it follows standards and
practices outlined by kubebuilder.

To work on CRD definitions, after changes always run `make manifests && make generate`. The CRDs can be found under the
`api` folder.

### Testing the Controller

To test the controller locally you need to build it first with `make`.

There are two ways to test a controller. In-cluster or running it locally. In either cases a cluster is required to run
the manager first. Using kind, create a cluster with:

```
kind create cluster --name controller-test
```

If in-cluster is the preferred way to test the controller, create a kind registry that kind can pull images from.
To do that follow [this](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/local-registry/) guide.

Once a local registry exists, build the controller image with:

```
docker build -t localhost:5001/replication-controller/manager:v0.0.1 .
```

When it's done, push it to the local registry:

```
docker push localhost:5001/replication-controller/manager:v0.0.1
```

Now the controller can be installed onto the cluster. Before that, install all crds and rbacs with `make install`.
There is a deployment manifest located [here](config/manager/deployment.yaml) which can be used to install the
controller.

_Note_: If a local kind cluster with local registry is used, change the `image: ` value from
`image: open-component-model/replication-controller` to `localhost:5001/replication-controller/manager:v0.0.1` so the Kind workers can
pull to image from the local registry.

If it's enough to run the manager locally, you don't need a local registry. Simply run:

```
./bin/manager -zap-log-level 4
```
